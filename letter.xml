	<salutation>Dear Sir:</salutation>
	<paragraph>It is our privilege to inform you about our new database managed with <bold>XML</bold>. This new system allows you to reduce the load on your inventory list server by having the client machine perform the work of sorting and filtering the data.</paragraph>
